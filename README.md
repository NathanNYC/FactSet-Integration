# FactSet-Integration
FactSet codes integration using Jupyter notebook and Excel, for formatting codes across potentially thousands of tickers (rule-based trading, stock screening, etc.) 

This Python project, being built using Jupyter notebook (Anaconda), requires the user to have a file with .CSV files, and a live FactSet account

Imports a list of tickers, and wraps them up with =FDS codes (FactSet pulls), to bring in fundamental data

Can be leveraged for rule-based trading systems, and/or stock screening, or just for informational/dashboard purposes
